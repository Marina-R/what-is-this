# What is this?
> An exploration of "this" in Javascript.

## Instructions
You are a scientist who has just discovered a *mysterious* new element in your lab. Since creativity isn't your strong suit, you name the element `this`. Your job is to figure out the properties of this new element as well as how it interacts with its environment. Run through each of these examples one by one (commenting out the previous example and uncomment the current example as 
necessary). In the comments section below each example fill in what `this` is referencing inside of the whatIsThis function. Why? If it throws an error, why is it throwing an error?
